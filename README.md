# King of Blood City - Java RPG
This is a 2d story teller/adventure rpg game built with Java. This was a group project for my COMP 055 - Application Development class. My group consisted of Greg Jewell, Nitin Pinnamaneni, Pranav Jammalamadaka. 

This project was built in 2 months. We used Eclipse as our primary IDE, with Git for version control.
